    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p id= "bio">I am a computer science student at the University of Miami. I am a web developer,
      guitar player, and UAS pilot. I enjoy creating new things, and always learning
      ways to be innovative and independent of automation. </p>

      <h3>Aerial Photography</h3>
      <p class = "skilldesc"> At 18, once I got up in the sky with my DJI Mavic Pro,
        my eyes were opened. I was seeing the world in a new
        way no one could ever understand. I am now a 14 CFR Part 107 certified drone
        pilot, and have gained a primary focus on real estate projects, events, and
        videography.</p>
